/** This interface represents a handler for discrete events triggered
 * during ODE integration.
 *
 * <p>Some events can be triggered at discrete times as an ODE problem
 * is solved. This occurs for example when the integration process
 * should be stopped as some state is reached (G-stop facility) when the
 * precise date is unknown a priori, or when the derivatives have
 * discontinuities, or simply when the user wants to monitor some
 * states boundaries crossings.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>These events are defined as occurring when a <code>g</code>
 * switching function sign changes.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since events are only problem-dependent and are triggered by the
 * independent <i>time</i> variable and the state vector, they can
 * occur at virtually any time, unknown in advance. The integrators will
 * take care to avoid sign changes inside the steps, they will reduce
 * the step size when such an event is detected in order to put this
 * event exactly at the end of the current step. This guarantees that
 * step interpolation (which always has a one step scope) is relevant
 * even in presence of discontinuities. This is independent from the
 * stepsize control provided by integrators that monitor the local
 * error (this event handling feature is available for all integrators,
 * including fixed step ones).</p>

   * the step handler itself is called (see below for scheduling). It
   * allows the user to update his internal data to acknowledge the fact

   * or continue integration, possibly with a reset state or derivatives.</p>

   *   with the <code>isLast</code> flag of the {@link
   *   org.apache.commons.math.ode.sampling.StepHandler#handleStep handleStep}
   *   method set to true and the integration will be stopped,</li>
   *   <li>if {@link #RESET_STATE} is returned, the {@link #resetState
   *   resetState} method will be called once the step handler has
   *   finished its task, and the integrator will also recompute the
   *   derivatives,</li>

   *   will recompute the derivatives,

   * org.apache.commons.math.ode.sampling.StepInterpolator, boolean)
   * handleStep(interpolator, isLast)} is to call this method first and
   * <code>handleStep</code> afterwards. This scheduling allows the integrator to
   * pass <code>true</code> as the <code>isLast</code> parameter to the step
   * handler to make it aware the step will be the last one if this method
   * returns {@link #STOP}. As the interpolator may be used to navigate back
   * throughout the last step (as {@link
   * org.apache.commons.math.ode.sampling.StepNormalizer StepNormalizer}
   * does for example), user code called by this method and user
   * code called by step handlers may experience apparently out of order values
   * of the independent time variable. As an example, if the same user object
   * implements both this {@link EventHandler EventHandler} interface and the
   * {@link org.apache.commons.math.ode.sampling.FixedStepHandler FixedStepHandler}
   * interface, a <em>forward</em> integration may call its
   * <code>eventOccurred</code> method with t = 10 first and call its
   * <code>handleStep</code> method with t = 9 afterwards. Such out of order
   * calls are limited to the size of the integration step for {@link
   * org.apache.commons.math.ode.sampling.StepHandler variable step handlers} and
   * to the size of the fixed step for {@link
   * org.apache.commons.math.ode.sampling.FixedStepHandler fixed step handlers}.</p>

   * when times increases around event (note that increase is measured with respect
   * to physical time, not with respect to integration which may go backward in time)
   * @return indication of what the integrator should do next, this
