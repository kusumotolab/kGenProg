/**
 * An interface to classes that implement an algorithm to calculate the
 * Cholesky decomposition of a real symmetric positive-definite matrix.
 * <p>This interface is based on the class with similar name from the
 * <a href="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/">JAMA</a> library, with the
 * following changes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a {@link #getLT() getLT} method has been added,</li>
 *   <li>the <code>isspd</code> method has been removed, the constructors of
 *   implementation classes being expected to throw {@link
 *   NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException} when a matrix cannot be decomposed,</li>
 *   <li>a {@link #getDeterminant() getDeterminant} method has been added,</li>
 *   <li>the <code>solve</code> method has been replaced by a {@link
 *   #getSolver() getSolver} method and the equivalent method provided by
 *   the returned {@link DecompositionSolver}.</li>
 * </ul>
