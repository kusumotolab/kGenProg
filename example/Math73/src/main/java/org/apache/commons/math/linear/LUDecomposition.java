/**
 * An interface to classes that implement an algorithm to calculate the
 * LU-decomposition of a real matrix.
 * <p>The LU-decomposition of matrix A is a set of three matrices: P, L and U
 * such that P&times;A = L&times;U. P is a rows permutation matrix that is used
 * to rearrange the rows of A before so that it can be decomposed. L is a lower
 * triangular matrix with unit diagonal terms and U is an upper triangular matrix.</p>
 * <p>This interface is based on the class with similar name from the
 * <a href="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/">JAMA</a> library.</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a {@link #getP() getP} method has been added,</li>
 *   <li>the <code>det</code> method has been renamed as {@link #getDeterminant()
 *   getDeterminant},</li>
 *   <li>the <code>getDoublePivot</code> method has been removed (but the int based
 *   {@link #getPivot() getPivot} method has been kept),</li>
 *   <li>the <code>solve</code> and <code>isNonSingular</code> methods have been replaced
 *   by a {@link #getSolver() getSolver} method and the equivalent methods provided by
 *   the returned {@link DecompositionSolver}.</li>
 * </ul>
