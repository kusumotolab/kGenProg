              Apache Commons Math 3.1.1 RELEASE NOTES

The Commons Math team is pleased to announce the release of commons-math3-3.1.1

The Math project is a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common practical problems not immediately available in the Java programming language or commons-lang.

This is a point release: It fixes a bug that renders version 3.1 unusable
 in some situations (see details below).

Changes in this version include:


Fixed Bugs:
o MATH-924:  Added a (minimal) "DiagonalMatrix" implementation, such that the
        case of a large number of uncorrelated observations is handled
        efficiently.
