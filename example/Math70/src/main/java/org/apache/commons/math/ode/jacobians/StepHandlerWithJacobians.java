/**
 * This interface represents a handler that should be called after
 * each successful step.
 *
 * <p>The ODE integrators compute the evolution of the state vector at
 * some grid points that depend on their own internal algorithm. Once
 * they have found a new grid point (possibly after having computed
 * several evaluation of the derivative at intermediate points), they
 * provide it to objects implementing this interface. These objects
 * typically either ignore the intermediate steps and wait for the
 * last one, store the points in an ephemeris, or forward them to
 * specialized processing or output methods.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that is is possible to register a {@link
 * org.apache.commons.math.ode.sampling.StepHandler classical step handler}
 * in the low level integrator used to build a {@link FirstOrderIntegratorWithJacobians}
 * rather than implementing this class. The step handlers registered at low level
 * will see the big compound state whether the step handlers defined by this interface
 * see the original state, and its jacobians in separate arrays.</p>
 *
 * <p>The compound state is guaranteed to contain the original state in the first
 * elements, followed by the jacobian with respect to initial state (in row order),
 * followed by the jacobian with respect to parameters (in row order). If for example
 * the original state dimension is 6 and there are 3 parameters, the compound state will
 * be a 60 elements array. The first 6 elements will be the original state, the next 36
 * elements will be the jacobian with respect to initial state, and the remaining 18 elements
 * will be the jacobian with respect to parameters.</p>
 *
 * <p>Dealing with low level step handlers is cumbersome if one really needs the jacobians
 * in these methods, but it also prevents many data being copied back and forth between
 * state and jacobians on one side and compound state on the other side. So for performance
 * reasons, it is recommended to use this interface <em>only</em> if jacobians are really
 * needed and to use lower level handlers if only state is needed.</p>
