This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the 
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits. TBA how to use this with SVN.

To generate the release notes from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate
mv target/announcement/math-release-notes.vm RELEASE_NOTES.txt
then tweak the formatting 
(e.g. copy/paste the description to replace the one-line version)
and commit

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

    <release version="2.1" date="2010-04-02" description="
This is primarily a maintenance release, but it also includes new features and enhancements.

  Users of version 2.0 are encouraged to upgrade to 2.1, as this release includes some important bug fixes.

  See the detailed list of changes below for full description of all bug fixes and enhancements.

  This release contains some minor API compatibility breaks with version 2.0:
  the return type of RealVector.copy() has been changed to AbstractRealVector;
  the no-argument constructor of MatrixUtils() has been made private;
  the mapXxxToSelf methods of OpenMapRealVector have been removed and some method return types have been changed in this class;
  new methods have been added to the RealVector interface;
  several fields in AdaptiveStepSizeIntegrator have been made final;
  DummyStepInterpolator requires an additional argument for one of its constructors;
  some protected fields have been removed from AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer, AbstractScalarDifferentiableOptimizer and AbstractLinearOptimizer;
  and the isOptimal(SimplexTableau) method has been removed from SimplexSolver. ">

        ODE solvers into optimization or root finding algorithms, which in turn can be
        used to solve Boundary Value Problems (BVP). There are no implementations (yet)
        of BVP solvers in the library.

    <release version="2.0" date="2009-08-03" description="
This is a major release. It combines bug fixes, new features and
changes to existing features. Most notable among the new features are:
decomposition algorithms in the linear algebra package (LU, QR, Cholesky,
SVD, eigen decomposition) which are based on the popular JAMA API (but
much faster); support for sparse matrices and vectors;
support for any field-based matrix (Complex, Fraction ...);
support for genetic algorithms;
several new optimization algorithms (Dantzig's simplex for linear
constrained problems, conjugate gradient, Brent);
support for curve fitting with special cases for harmonic and polynomial
functions;
support for state derivative in ODE step handlers;
new multistep integrators (Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton) with
variable stepsize;
regression algorithms;
rank transformations;
Mersenne twister pseudo random number generator.
This release is NOT source and binary compatible with earlier versions
of Commons Math. Starting with version 2.0 of the library, the minimal
version of the Java platform required to compile and use commons-math
is Java 5.  Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version, as in addition
to new features, this release includes numerous bug fixes.  Users of 
Commons Math 1.0-1.2 should recompile their code against the 2.0 jar. 
Most of the compilation errors users will encounter after the switch
will be due to classes moved due to package reorganization.  These errors
are simply solved by adjusting the import statements in users code.">
