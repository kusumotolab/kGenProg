/** This class is a wrapper allowing to sample a
 * {@link ComputableFunction}.

 * <p>The sample produced is a regular sample. It can be specified by
 * several means :
 * <ul>
 *   <li> from an initial point a step and a number of points</li>
 *   <li> from a range and a number of points</li>
 *   <li> from a range and a step between points.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In the latter case, the step can optionaly be adjusted in order to
 * have the last point exactly at the upper bound of the range.</p>

 * <p>The sample points are computed on demand, they are not
 * stored. This allow to use this method for very large sample with
 * little memory overhead. The drawback is that if the same sample
 * points are going to be requested several times, they will be
 * recomputed each time. In this case, the user should consider
 * storing the points by some other means.</p>
